# Hi, I’m Zach Tunstall

I’m a GIS web developer from North Carolina, USA. My interests are in using computer aided software to model environmental phenomena. I'm skilled in making spatial data visualizations, perform remote sensing tasks and creating custom GIS tools. My coding skillset includes a little of both front-end and back-end development with practical experience using Python, JS, HTML, CSS, R, and SQL.”
